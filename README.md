# Travel Landing Page - WIP
I was looking for inspiration to create a FrontEnd project and found this Travel design on Dribble. There were so many awesome designs I couldn't figure out what to work with so I ended up on this Travel Landing Page.

I also wanted some animations from GSAP and to use Tailwindcss, which I never used before so I figure this would be a good challenge.
